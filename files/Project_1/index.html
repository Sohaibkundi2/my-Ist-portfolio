                <p>'Nikola Tesla' (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]—died January 7,
                    1943,New York , New York, U.S.) Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and
                    patented the rotating magnetic field the basis of most alternating-current machinery.
                    He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission. He immigrated to
                    the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current
                    dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the Tesla
                    coil,an induction coil widely used in radio technology

                    <tr>
                        <td>He established his own laboratory, where his inventive mind could be given free rein. He
                            experimented with shadowgraphs similar to those that later were to be used by Wilhelm
                            Röntgen when he discovered X-rays in 1895. Tesla’s countless experiments included work on a
                            carbon button lamp, on the power of electrical resonance, and on various types of lighting.

                <h2>His Goals</h2>
                <p>In order to allay fears of alternating currents, Tesla gave exhibitions in his laboratory in which he
                    lit lamps by allowing electricity to flow through his body. He was often invited to lecture at home
                    and abroad. The Tesla coil, which he invented in 1891, is widely used today in radio and television
                    sets and other electronic equipment. That year also marked the date of Tesla’s U.S. citizenship.</p>
